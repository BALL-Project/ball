written during the master thesis project: 
"Direct 3D Structure Generation from Combinatorial Libraries"
(supervised by Dr. Philipp Thiel)

Information about Ligand3DGenerator can be found in the original thesis
(contact me if you need a copy). However the sub-framework was restructured
in oder to better integrate it within the BALL library. Relevant modules are:

# Main functionality classes:
source/STRUCTURE/LIGAND3DGEN/structureAssembler
STRUCTURE/LIGAND3DGEN/combiAssembler

# Higher level classes:
source/STRUCTURE/LIGAND3DGEN/moleculeConnector
source/STRUCTURE/LIGAND3DGEN/linkerBuilder
source/STRUCTURE/clashResolver
source/STRUCTURE/fragmenter
source/STRUCTURE/rmsdBinner
source/STRUCTURE/UCK (contains now Canonicalizer class)

# Basic classes:
source/STRUCTURE/LIGAND3DGEN/ligand3DBase (contains now Matcher class)
source/STRUCTURE/LIGAND3DGEN/ioModule
source/STRUCTURE/LIGAND3DGEN/starAligner

# Data files (relevant for StructureAssembler and combiAssembler)
/data/fragments/template_rigids.line
/data/fragments/template_sites.sdf
