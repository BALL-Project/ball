The fragments (R-groups) are derived by searching databases for a certain 
scaffold structure. From every found structure all parts (remainders that
are found when subtracting the scaffold) are saved giving the respective
R-Groups.
Recombining the found R-groups in new ways gives significant larger set of new 
combined structures.


Experiment1:
* from database: http://www.daylight.com/products/databases/ACD.html
* derived from originally 960 thioureas and 575 alpha-haloketones
* Virtual library size is 50,285,664 (combined) structures

Experiment2:
* from database: http://www.daylight.com/products/databases/WDI.html
* derived from originally 164 1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones
* Virtual library size is 284,544 (combined) structures
