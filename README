BUILD BALL
----------
  To install BALL, use the CMake build system.

  * Enter the toplevel directory of BALL (the one containing the
    CMakeLists.txt file and the source and include folders) 

  * Then create a folder "build" and change into it 

  * Call "cmake .." (if you have a contrib directory for BALL, use
	  "cmake .. -DBALL_CONTRIB_PATH=path_to_your_contrib")

  * Type "make"

  If you want to build packages (currently mostly interesting on MacOS and
  Windows), add the flag "-DBALL_ENABLE_PACKAGING=true" to the cmake command
  line and run "make package" instead of a plain make.

  On Windows, make sure to run the commands in a Visual Studio command shell.

  For further details of the build process, please refer to our Wiki on
  https://github.com/BALL-Project/ball/wiki/DevelopmentEnvironment

  To build the documentation, run "make doc". Alternatively, you can refer
  to the online documentation:
