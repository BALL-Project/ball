	<h3>The Backbone model</h3>

Since proteins are composed of an often large number of amino acids,
the number of atoms is typically quite high. Therefore, models that show
each individual atom or each bond in the molecule tend to become too
complex, hiding the structural information in often unnecessary details.
<br>
Fortunately, it is often sufficient to visualize the chain of amino acids
as a thread in space, the <it>backbone</it> of the protein.
