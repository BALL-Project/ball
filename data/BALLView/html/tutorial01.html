<h3>Building a peptide from a given sequence</h3>

Welcome to the BALLView tutorial. It will show you some of 
BALLViews main features. The tutorial takes approximately 15 minutes and 
is divided in several steps, which have to be finished one by one.
The button "Next" will be enabled after finishing each individual step.
<br>
<br>
We start by building a polypeptide from an aminoacid sequence.
To do so, open the PeptideBuilder dialog by clicking the menu entry
<br>
<b>"Build->BuildPeptide"</b>.
<br>
<br>
Then enter the sequence ARND with the keyboard in the label field at the top. 
(As an alternative you can also press the upper four amino acid buttons.)
This will create a polypeptide with the aminosequence
(Alanin, Arginin, Asparagine, Aspartic acid). 
<br>
Then press the "<b>Build</b>" button.This will enable the next step of the tutorial.
Press Next to continue.
