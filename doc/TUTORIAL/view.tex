\noindent
Visualization not only covers the graphical representation of things (\eg
molecules, measurement data, \dots) but also the graphical user interface
(GUI). Both jobs can be done using \class{VIEW} functionality. Both areas are
discussed in the next few sections.


\section{Modularity}

In general most of the time in GUI programming is spent on implementing the 
interactions of the individual elements of the user interface with each other 
(\eg defining menu entries, button actions, etc.). In order to reduce these 
efforts, the functionality in the VIEW library has been bundled into different
modules (\eg OpenGL rendering, force field methods, the scripting language 
interface, etc.), which can be freely combined to an application. These modules
automatically connect to each other and thus allow the user to add further 
functionality with as little as a single line of code. To this end, we have 
designed a set of  base classes describing the interactions of the interface 
elements. The two most important components in this design are 
\class{Main\-Control}, the application's main window, and 
\class{Modular\-Widget}, the base class for all modules.
The next pages will describe the modeling and implementation of this approach.
\label{modularity}

\paragraph{MainControl} 
\hspace*{\fill}\\
The class \class{Main\-Control} is derived from Qt's \class{QMain\-Window} and 
thus realizes an application's main window. It contains only the most essential
data structures: The \class{Composite\-Manager} stores all molecular entities
(\class{Composite} objects) and the \class{Primitive\-Manager} is responsible 
for the representations (\ie geometric models) and the thread for their
(re)calculation. All additional functionality (\eg reading and writing of 
structures, OpenGL visualization, etc.) are added to the main window by 
instantiating one of the classes derived from \class{Modular\-Widget}. 

\paragraph{Modular Widgets}
\hspace*{\fill}\\
\class{Modular\-Widget} is a common base class for all the modules, that can be
combined to form an entire application. While the modular widgets are widely 
independent, they can still notify each other about the current work flow. 
This is achieved by a messaging system, that allows a \class{Modular\-Widget}
to send a message which is then received by all other modular widgets (see 
Section~\ref{message}).

In addition to the messaging system, the \class{Modular\-Widget} class provides 
many other commonly needed features to ease and accelerate the development of
new modules:
\begin{itemize}
%\item Sending and receiving of messages
  \item Showing status and error messages
  \item Management of menu and toolbar entries 
  \item Management of preferences dialogs
  \item Reading/writing of settings from/to a configuration file
  \item Registering of supported file formats \eg for parsing command line
        arguments or drag-and-drop support
  \item Access to individual instances with the method \class{getInstance()}
  \item Access to the \class{Main\-Control} and thus to the loaded molecules 
        and representations
  \item Locking of molecular entities while multithreaded code is running
\end{itemize}

For many different tasks (see Table \ref{table:tmw}), the VIEW library already 
contains a wide variety of modular widgets. Since they are widely independent 
from each other, they can easily be combined to an application. All that is 
needed, is the instantiating of modular widgets with the \class{Main\-Control} 
as their parent, as can be seen in the following code snippet:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
Mainframe::Mainframe(...)
  : MainControl(...)
{
  new LogView(this);          // widget (1)
  new DatasetControl(this);   // widget (2)
  new MolecularControl(this); // widget (3)
  new GeometricControl(this); // widget (4)
  new Scene(this);            // widget (5)
}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
These few lines of code (header includes were omitted for brevity) create a 
fully-fledged molecular structure viewer. In addition to using already 
existing widgets, users can easily implement new ones, especially since 
\class{Modular\-Widget} already offers many common features (see above). As a 
result, users can freely combine new and existing widgets both to extend 
\mbox{BALLView} with new functionality or to create entirely new 
custom-tailored applications.

\paragraph{Example for the implementation of a modular widget}
\hspace*{\fill}\\
To visualize how new modular widgets can be created, the following pages will 
outline the implementation of the class \class{LabelDialog}, which is part of 
the VIEW library. Its purpose is to create labels in the 3D view for a list of 
highlighted molecular entities and it has the following capabilities:
The menu entry {"Add Label"} toggles the dialog's visibility and is disabled 
if no molecular entities are highlighted in the \class{MolecularControl}.
When the dialog is shown, the user can select a font and its color, the 
desired text for the label(s), and choose if only one label is to be created 
for the entire selection or one label for every atom/residue. When the 
"Apply" button is pressed, a new \class{Representation} is created with the 
newly created label(s). For convenience the chosen color and font are stored 
in the application's configuration file for future usage.

The dialog's layout was done with the program "Qt Designer" (see 
Section ~\ref{designer}). This results in a source file, containing the base 
class \class{Ui\_LabelDialogData}, which defines the dialog's layout. The 
actual dialog class is derived from this layout class. This procedure 
accelerates the development process and makes the dialog's layout independent 
from its function. The following code is the content of the header file for 
the actual dialog. The includes, namespaces, and some documentation lines 
were omitted for brevity and the overloaded methods from the 
\class{Modular\-Widget} base class were marked.

\begin{lstlisting}{}
class BALL_VIEW_EXPORT LabelDialog 
  : public QDialog,
    public Ui_LabelDialogData,
    public ModularWidget
{
  // macro needed for Qt's slot mechanism:
  Q_OBJECT

  // Macro from the Embeddable class:
  BALL_EMBEDDABLE(LabelDialog,ModularWidget)
	
  public:
  LabelDialog(QWidget *parent = NULL, const char *name = NULL );
  virtual ~LabelDialog();
					
  // method for message handling, overloaded from ModularWidget
  virtual void onNotify(Message* message);
					
  // method for reading settings, overloaded from ModularWidget
  virtual void fetchPreferences(INIFile &inifile);
  // method for written settings, overloaded from ModularWidget
  virtual void writePreferences(INIFile &inifile);
		
  // method for e.g. initializing menu entries, overloaded
  //   from ModularWidget
  virtual void initializeWidget(MainControl& main_control);

  // Overloaded from ModularWidget
  virtual void checkMenu(MainControl& main_control);
	
  protected Q_SLOTS:
  virtual void accept();
  virtual void editColor();
  virtual void addTag();
  virtual void fontSelected();
  virtual void modeChanged();
  void textChanged();

  protected:
  Representation* createOneLabel_();
  Representation* createMultipleLabels_();
  QAction*    menu_entry_;
  ColorRGBA   custom_color_;
  QFont       font_;
};
\end{lstlisting}

The following paragraphs will discuss the actual implementation, starting 
with the constructor: It must be called with the \class{Main\-Control} as 
parent to enable the registration of the \class{Modular\-Widget}. Since this 
example class is derived from three other classes, these also have to be 
initialized. The function \class{setupUi} stems from the ''*.ui' file and 
defines the layout of the dialog. Next the individual buttons and check boxes 
are connected to their slots. The call of \class{register\-Widget} is of 
special importance since it enables the internal mechanism that connects all 
modular widgets with each other (\ie the messaging system).

\begin{lstlisting}{}
LabelDialog::LabelDialog(QWidget* parent, const char* name)
  :  QDialog(parent),
     Ui_LabelDialogData(),
     ModularWidget(name)
{
  // apply the dialogs layout:
  Ui_LabelDialogData::setupUi(this);

  // signals and slots connections
  connect(apply_button_,  SIGNAL(clicked()),
              this, SLOT(accept()));
  connect(buttonCancel,   SIGNAL(clicked()),
              this, SLOT(reject()));
  connect(edit_button,    SIGNAL(clicked()),
              this, SLOT(editColor()));
  connect(add_tag_button, SIGNAL(clicked()),
              this, SLOT(addTag()));
  connect(font_button,    SIGNAL(clicked()),
              this, SLOT(fontSelected()));
  connect(all_items,      SIGNAL(toggled(bool)),
              this, SLOT(modeChanged()));
  connect(text_box,       SIGNAL(editTextChanged(const QString&)),
              this, SLOT(textChanged()));

  setWindowTitle("Add Label");
  setObjectName(name);
  hide();

  // register the widget with the MainControl
  ModularWidget::registerWidget(this);
}
\end{lstlisting}

All modular widgets can have their own menu entries in the applications menu 
bar. These entries should be initialized in the virtual method 
\class{initialize\-Widget}, which will be automatically called by the 
\class{Main\-Control} for all registered \class{Modular\-Widget} subclasses. 
For this concrete class, the method creates the menu entry "Add Label" and 
connects it to a slot, which will open the dialog. The creation of the menu 
entry is done through a call of \class{insertMenuEntry}, which will also 
create the given menu (if it does not yet exist) and return a pointer to a 
\class{QAction}. This pointer is then assigned to the variable \class{id\_}, 
which will later be used for enabling and disabling the menu entry.
Corresponding to the method \class{initializeWidget} exists the 
\class{initializePreferencesTab} method to add sub pages to the applications 
preferences dialog. Since this dialog does not have a configuration dialog, 
this function is not needed in the \class{LabelDialog} class.

\begin{lstlisting}{}
void LabelDialog::initializeWidget(MainControl& main_control)
{
  menu_entry_ = ModularWidget::insertMenuEntry(
                  MainControl::DISPLAY, "Add Label", this,
                  SLOT(show()));
  setMenuHint("Add a label for selected molecular objects");   
}
\end{lstlisting}

The next method \class{onNotify} does the message processing: \label{onNotify}
It is overloaded from the \class{Modular\-Widget} class and gets called when a 
\class{Message} arrives for the widget. In the \class{LabelDialog} class, it 
does the following: If no molecular entities are highlighted in the 
\class{MolecularControl}, the dialog's "Apply" button is disabled and the menu 
entries are checked if they have to be enabled/disabled. This is done to 
ensure, that the dialog can not be used while \eg a simulation is running, 
since the molecular entities could changed at any time. This is checked in the 
\class{checkMenu} method with a call to \class{Main\-Control::\-isBusy()}, 
which returns true if a modular widget locked the molecular entities because 
they could be changed or if an model update is underway.

\begin{lstlisting}{}
void LabelDialog::onNotify(Message* message)
{
  ControlSelectionMessage* sm = 
    RTTI::castTo<ControlSelectionMessage>(*message);

  if (sm != 0)
  {
    // disable apply button, if selection is empty
    apply_button_->setEnabled(!sm->getSelection().empty();
    checkMenu(*getMainControl());
  }
}

void LabelDialog::checkMenu(MainControl& mc)
{
  Size selection_size = mc.getMolecularControlSelection().size();
  menu_entry_->setEnabled(selection_size && !mc.isBusy());
}
\end{lstlisting}

The following methods are only of minor interest and just shown for the sake of
completeness. They are called when a user clicks on the corresponding buttons 
and perform auxiliary functions, like choosing the label's font or color.

\begin{lstlisting}{}
void LabelDialog::editColor()
{
  custom_color_.set(chooseColor(color_sample_));
}

void LabelDialog::addTag()
{
  QString tag;
  if      (tag_box->currentText() == "Name")           tag = "%N";
  else if (tag_box->currentText() == "Residue ID")     tag = "%I";
  else if (tag_box->currentText() == "Atom Type")      tag = "%T";
  else if (tag_box->currentText() == "Atom Charge")    tag = "%C";
  else if (tag_box->currentText() == "Atom Type Name") tag = "%Y";
  else if (tag_box->currentText() == "Element")        tag = "%E";

  text_box->lineEdit()->setText(text_box->currentText() + tag);
}

void LabelDialog::fontSelected()
{
  bool ok = true;
  QFont font = QFontDialog::getFont(&ok, font_, 0);
  if (!ok) return;

  font_label->setFont(font);
  font_ = font;
}

void LabelDialog::modeChanged()
{
  tag_box->setEnabled(!all_items->isChecked());
  add_tag_button->setEnabled(!all_items->isChecked());
}

void LabelDialog::textChanged()
{
  apply_button_->setEnabled(text_box->currentText() != "");
}
\end{lstlisting}

When a user presses the dialog's "Apply" button, the method \class{accept()} is
called. It does the actual label creation and adds the label(s) to the 3D view:
First the current list of highlighted molecular entities is obtained from the 
\class{Main\-Control}. Then a \class{LabelModel} processor is created and added 
to a \class{Representation}. Next the values from the dialog are applied to the
\class{LabelModel} and the list of molecular entities is stored in the 
\class{Representation}. This approach may seem a bit complex but it has a 
distinct advantage: The position of the label will be automatically updated if 
the 3D positions of the molecular entities should change. Finally the 
\class{Representation} is stored in the \class{Main\-Control} and it is 
rendered in the 3D view with a call of 
\class{Main\-Control::\-update(Representation\&)}.
The methods in the \class{Main\-Control} for inserting and updating 
representations were added just for convenience reasons and contain only the 
code for sending the corresponding messages. As an example, 
\class{Main\-Control::\-insert(Representation\&)} only consists of the following 
code:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
  notify_(new RepresentationMessage(representation, 
                                    RepresentationMessage::ADD));
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
After the last modular widget was notified, the message will be automatically 
deleted. Therefore messages that are about to be send, have to be created on 
the heap.

\begin{lstlisting}{}
void LabelDialog::accept()
{
  List<Composite*> selection = 
    getMainControl()->getMolecularControlSelection();

  // no selection present => return
  if (selection.empty()) return;

  Representation* rep = new Representation;
  rep->setProperty(Representation::PROPERTY__ALWAYS_FRONT);
  rep->setModelType(MODEL_LABEL);

  LabelModel* model = new LabelModel;
  model->setText(ascii(text_box->currentText()));
  model->setColor(custom_color_);
  model->setFont(font_);

  if      (    all_items->isChecked())
  { model->setMode(LabelModel::ONE_LABEL);
  }
  else if (   every_atom->isChecked())
  { model->setMode(LabelModel::ALL_ATOMS);
  }
  else if (every_residue->isChecked())
  { model->setMode(LabelModel::ALL_RESIDUES);
  }
  else if (   every_item->isChecked())
  { model->setMode(LabelModel::ALL_ITEMS);
  }

  rep->setModelProcessor(model);

  // process all objects in the selection list
  List<Composite*>::ConstIterator list_it = selection.begin();
  List<const Composite*> composites;
  for (; list_it != selection.end(); ++list_it)
  {
    composites.push_back(*list_it);
  }

  rep->setComposites(composites);
  getMainControl()->insert(*rep);
  getMainControl()->update(*rep);
  text_box->addItem(text_box->currentText());
  setStatusbarText("Label added.");
}
\end{lstlisting}

The next two methods are responsible for reading and writing the of this 
widget's settings. The first method, \class{fetchPreferences}, restores the 
settings from the configuration file. If the this file has a section with the 
name \class{WINDOWS} and a key ''\class{Label::customcolor}'' within, then the 
content of this key is read and converted to a color, which is then assigned 
to the dialog's label and stored in the variable \class{custom\_color\_}.

\begin{lstlisting}{}
void LabelDialog::fetchPreferences(INIFile& inifile)
{
  // restore the color 
  if (inifile.hasEntry("WINDOWS", "Label::customcolor"))
  {
    custom_color_.set(inifile.getValue("WINDOWS",
                                       "Label::customcolor"));
    setColor(color_sample_, custom_color_);
  }

  // restore the font
  if (inifile.hasEntry("WINDOWS", "Label::font"))
  {
    font_.fromString(inifile.getValue("WINDOWS",
                                      "Label::font").c_str());
  }
  font_label->setFont(font_);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
To write all user defined options in a configuration file, the method
\class{Modular\-Widget::\-write\-Preferences} was overridden:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
void LabelDialog::writePreferences(INIFile& inifile)
{
  ModularWidget::writePreferences(inifile);

  // store the color
  inifile.insertValue("WINDOWS", "Label::customcolor",
                      custom_color_);
  // store the font
  inifile.insertValue("WINDOWS", "Label::font",
                      ascii(font_.toString()));
}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
This concludes the implementation of the \class{LabelDialog} class. It can be
used in a derived \class{Main\-Control} class, simply by adding the following 
line:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
  new LabelDialog(this, "LabelDialog");
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
This one line of code is all that is needed to make the dialog work, all needed
function calls inside the \class{LabelDialog} class will be automatically done
by the VIEW framework.

This example demonstrates, how effective the encapsulation of features into 
distinct modules works: Since the modules are mostly independent from each 
other and the interface base classes take care of all basic functions, it is 
very easy to extend the application with new features.


\section{Messaging System}
\label{message}

A special mechanism was needed for allowing the individual modular widgets to
be mostly independent from each other but still be able work together \ie by
notifying each other about the current work flow. This was achieved by a 
messaging system, that allows a \class{Modular\-Widget} to send a message which
is then received by all other modular widgets. As an example: The 
\class{Molecular\-Control} provides a hierarchical overview of the loaded 
molecules and notifies the other widgets when a user highlights some of its 
entries. This is needed, since other modular widgets offer tool bar entries 
for features (like saving molecules) that operate on the currently highlighted 
objects. These entries get disabled if no molecular item is highlighted. To 
notify the other widgets, the \class{Molecular\-Control} sends a 
\class{Control\-Selection\-Message} which is then received by the 
\class{Molecular\-File\-Dialog}. This class provides the functionality for 
loading and writing molecular files and will then disable the corresponding 
menu and toolbar entries.

Since the modular widgets have to notify each other about many different 
events, the class \class{Message} has many subclasses (see 
Table~\ref{tab:messages}), which store different data types, like selections 
or object pointers. If a new event is introduced, it can easily be added by 
creating an other \class{Message} subclass.

\begin{table} [bht] %[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular} {|l|l|}
\hline
CompositeMessage             & SceneMessage\\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Derived message classes. All the individual classes can contain
specific datas and some have an addition enumeration type to differ between
subtypes of messages.}
\label{tab:messages}
\end{table}

The actual sending of messages is done in the method 
\class{Modular\-Widget::\-notify\_}, while the message is received by 
\class{Modular\-Widget::\-onNotify()} (for an example of a concrete 
implementation see Page~\pageref{onNotify}). In this method the modular widget 
has to decide if it needs to react to the message. This is in general done by 
using runtime type identification. In addition, many different messages also 
provide enumeration values for defining further specialized message subtypes. 
A \class{CompositeMessage} can \eg cope with the events of an added or deleted 
\class{Composite} by using the types 
\class{Composite\-Message::\-NEW\_COMPOSITE} or 
\class{Composite\-Message::\-REMOVED\_COMPOSITE}. The usage of these 
enumeration subtypes has the advantage, that much less subclasses are needed 
to distinguish different classes of events, resulting in a slimmer 
implementation. Thus we only added new \class{Message} subclasses, when a 
message had to transmit a new kind of data, or if no appropriate class yet 
existed.


\section{Design of the Visualization Classes}

\paragraph{Geometric objects}
\hspace*{\fill}\\%
\label{geometric_objects}%
\noindent%
We created a base class \class{GeometricObject} to provide a general interface
for geometric shapes, that can be calculated and rendered in the VIEW
framework. From this base class, we then derived the classes for the individual
tangible geometric objects (see Table~\ref{tab:go}). The instances of these 
derived classes are created by the different model processors and later get 
colored by the color processors, and stored in a \class{Representation}. The 
renderer classes can then translate their information such that they can \eg
be drawn on the screen or processed by an external program.

\begin{table} [ht] %[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular} {|l|l|}
\hline
Box             & Disc             \\
Label           & GridVisualisation\\
Mesh            & QuadMesh         \\
Point           & SimpleBox        \\
Sphere          & Tube             \\
Line            & TwoColoredLine   \\
Tube            & TwoColoredTube   \\
IlluminatedLine &                  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Overview of the different geometric objects that are supported in the
VIEW framework.}
\label{tab:go}
\end{table}

We created numerous derived \class{GeometricObject} classes, to guarantee that
virtually all thinkable shapes and objects can be visualized. If nevertheless 
in the future the need for a new kind of geometric object would arise, this 
could be realized with minimal effort: All that would have to be done, is to 
create a new derived \class{Geometric\-Object} class and add the corresponding 
rendering methods to the \class{Renderer} classes (see 
Page~\pageref{renderer}).

\label{representation}
\paragraph{Representations}
\hspace*{\fill}\\
\noindent
To offer the user an intuitive way of handling models and their coloring, we 
created the class \class{Representation}. For each visualized object, this 
class stores the selection of molecular entities, the used model and coloring 
method, the drawing style, and the geometric objects representing the model 
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:representation}). This approach has many advantages:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The different models and coloring methods can be freely combined.
  \item Users can combine as many different representations as they like to
        compose complex molecular visualizations.
  \item Individual representations can be enable/disable any time.
  \item It is possible to write project files, which store all representations
        for later usage.
  \item A \class{Representation} can easily be redrawn, when the corresponding
        atoms have changed.
  \item A user can disable all updates to a representation \eg to visualize the
        differences between two steps in a trajectory.
\end{itemize}

We wanted to make the creation and modification of representations as easily 
as possible. Thus we designed a user friendly dialog, which can assign all the 
different settings of a \class{Representation}.

The classes \class{ModelProcessor} and \class{ColorProcessor} which are 
responsible for creating the different models and coloring schemes are 
described in the section below.

{Each visualized object corresponds to an instance of the class 
\class{Representation}. The \class{ModelProcessor} creates 
\class{GeometricObjects}, \eg tubes or meshes for all atoms stored in the
\class{AtomContainers}. Next, the \class{ColorProcessor} colorizes the 
\class{GeometricObjects}, \eg by element, charge or temperature factor. The
individual model types and coloring methods are realized by derived classes.
This approach simplifies the creation of new models and coloring methods and 
allows their free combination.}
\label{fig:representation}
\end{figure*}

\paragraph{Models and Coloring}
\hspace*{\fill}\\
We created a wide variety of different models. All these model classes are 
derived from the \class{Model\-Processor}. This class is again derived from 
the BALL class \class{Unary\-Processor$<$Composite$>$}, which provides a 
general interface for recursively iterating and processing a \class{Composite} 
tree. Therefore a \class{Model\-Processor} can be be applied to entire 
proteins as well as to individual atoms, which makes it is easily possible to 
create models for user defined subselections of molecules. When a model 
processor is applied to such a selection, it first iterates over the 
\class{Composite} tree and collects the information necessary for the model's 
creation. With this information, the method 
\class{create\-Geometric\-Objects()} can then create the individual geometric 
object, which form the model. The geometric objects are created on the heap 
and stored in a list inside the \class{Representation}, which is then 
responsible for deleting them.

The counterpart to \class{Model\-Processor} is \class{Color\-Processor}, which 
iterates over a list of \class{Geometric\-Objects} and finds the corresponding 
color for each one. Currently 16 different coloring methods are implemented and
every single one is derived from \class{Color\-Processor}.

Since users directly perceive on how long it takes to create a representation,
we made great efforts to ensure maximum performance for the model and coloring 
calculations.

\paragraph{Renderer}\label{renderer}
\hspace*{\fill}\\
Currently \mbox{BALLView} supports two different renderers: Real time graphics 
are provided by the OpenGL renderer (\class{GL\-Renderer}) while high quality 
graphics are available through the POVRay exporter (\class{POV\-Renderer}).
Both classes are derived from a common base class \class{Renderer}, which 
provides a general interface. This ensures that in future versions, arbitrary 
renderer can easily be added by deriving a further class from \class{Renderer}.
The actual rendering of a \class{Representation} is done in the method
\class{Renderer::\-render(const Representation\&)}. It iterates over all 
geometric objects in the \class{Representation} and, by using runtime type 
identification, finds the corresponding rendering method:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
  if      (RTTI::isKindOf<Point>(*go))
  { renderPoint_(*(const Point*) go);
  }
  else if (RTTI::isKindOf<Disc>(*go))
  { renderDisc_( *(const Disc*)  go);
  }
  else if (RTTI::isKindOf<Line>(*go))
  { renderLine_( *(const Line*)  go);
  }
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent 
These methods are overridden in the derived classes with the real rendering
code, \eg OpenGL calls in the \class{GL\-Renderer}. This approach ensures that 
the different renderer can easily be extended with support for new kinds of 
geometric objects, simply by adding a new rendering method and an appropriate 
runtime check.

Unlike the OpenGL renderer, the \class{POV\-Renderer} does not provide real 
time graphics, but an interface to the external POVRay renderer. To do so, it 
translates the data in the geometric objects to a form that can be parsed by 
the POVRay application. The resulting text is then written to an output stream,
which is either a file or the standard console output.


\section{Creating Dialogs}
\label{designer}

To layout the dialogs in the VIEW library, we used the program "Qt Designer".
It is part of every Qt-package and provides a comfortable "What you see is what
you get" (WYSIWYG) interface for designing widgets. The result of the "Qt 
Designer" program is a ".ui" file, which is then transformed into a set of \CPP
source files by the Qt program "uic". These source files contain a base class, 
which defines the dialog's layout. The actual dialog class will be derived from
the layout class and contains the dialog's actual functionality.

While this procedure may seem a bit complicated, it is actually straightforward
and very useful: Not only does the "Qt Designer" WYSIWYG interface accelerate 
the development process, the resulting "*.ui" files also uncouple the dialogs' 
layout from its function. Thus a software engineer can extend the functionality
without having to care about the dialog's layout, while a GUI designer can 
change the layout without the need to adapt the source code.


\section{User Defined Settings}
\label{preferences}

We wanted to give BALLView's users the opportunity to adapt it to their liking 
in any thinkable way, including the different models, coloring methods, and 
display options. Therefore an extensible graphical user interface was needed 
for applying these settings. For this purpose, we developed the 
\class{Preferences} dialog, which can contain an arbitrary number of child 
dialogs. These child dialogs are stored in a \class{QWidget\-Stack} and shown 
as entries in a hierarchical list. If a user clicks on such an entry, the 
corresponding dialog is then shown in the widget stack. This approach allows 
to cluster the different settings in a hierarchical way and users can freely 
browse and apply the individual settings. Furthermore the \class{Preferences} 
dialog can have any number of child dialogs and still have a concise layout.
In an earlier implementation, we used a tab widget, which is the standard 
approach for such dialogs. This solution proved to be less suited, since the 
child dialogs can not be clustered and the layout becomes unhandy, if many 
children are added.

\paragraph{Automation of the (re)storing process}
\hspace*{\fill}\\
All the settings that can be adapted in the \class{Preferences} dialog, shall 
be stored when \mbox{BALLView} is closed. To this end all configuration 
dialogs have to store the content of their GUI elements, like line edits or 
check boxes. In the early versions of our implementation, every dialog 
provided its own routines for this purpose. Since this created a lot of 
overhead in means of redundant source code, we wanted to automate the 
(de)serialization: We designed a base class \class{Preferences\-Entry}, which 
can act as a base class for any dialog. It automatically registers a dialog's 
GUI elements, whose content is then later saved or restored. All what is now 
needed, is to add one line of code in the the dialog's constructor:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
  registerWidgets_();
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
This sole line ensures, that the dialog's data get stored or read. Compared to
the earlier implementation, which often had dozens of lines for this task, 
this is an essential improvement.

\paragraph{The storing process}
\hspace*{\fill}\\
To store the content of the registered GUI elements, their content is 
transformed into a string (see below) which is later written to the 
configuration file along with the name of the GUI element.

\begin{lstlisting}{}
  if (RTTI::isKindOf<QLabel>(*widget))
  { value = getColor(dynamic_cast<const QLabel*>(widget));
  }
  else if (RTTI::isKindOf<QLineEdit>(*widget))
  { value = ascii((dynamic_cast<const QLineEdit*>(widget))->text());
  }
  else if (RTTI::isKindOf<QCheckBox>(*widget))
  { value = String((dynamic_cast<const QCheckBox*>(widget))->isChecked());
  }
\end{lstlisting}

The resulting configuration file is line based and divided into sections,
which can correspond to individual dialogs. The following lines illustrate
the section for the dialog that configures and starts energy minimization runs.
>From these lines the whole content of the dialog can be reconstructed and thus 
the minimization settings restored.

\begin{lstlisting}{}
  [MINIMIZATION]
  energy_difference_lineedit=0.0001
  max_iterations_lineedit=100
  refresh_iterations_lineedit=25
  minimization_group=conjugate_button
  max_grad_lineedit=1.000000
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Further extensions}
\hspace*{\fill}\\
Since the described approach for storing the content of dialogs turned out to 
be very effective, we extended its usage. Now, dialogs no longer have to be 
child widgets in the \class{Preferences} dialog, to use this feature.
%Thus e.g.\ the dialogs for the setup of the individual forcefields can 
In addition, the \class{PreferencesEntry} class now also supports the storing 
of default values, that are applied when a dialog's ''Defaults'' button is 
pressed. In just the same way a dialog gets restored to its originally values, 
when the ''Cancel'' button is pressed.

Another extension was made to support more sophisticated GUI elements: We
created a base class \class{Extended\-Preferences\-Object} that defines an 
interface for (re)storing the content of composite widgets, like \eg the 
tables for the setup of the different coloring methods. This approach further
improves the extensibility, since new, derived 
\class{Extended\-Preferences\-Object} classes can be designed and added.
What is even more important: Compared to a basic implementation, the described
approach is also much less error-prone, since a developer can no longer
accidentally forget to add the (re)storing code for one GUI element.

\paragraph{Summary}
\hspace*{\fill}\\
We designed a very user-friendly way to apply any arbitrary number of options. 
In addition, the implemented approach is also very handy for developers, since 
it is very extensible and minimizes the efforts for (re)storing the content of 
further dialogs. 

The VIEW library in its current state has more than 20 dialogs, whose content 
is (re)stored. These dialogs have in total more than 200 widgets that contain 
user defined data. A conservative estimation of 8 lines of code per widget for 
the storing/restoring of its data, results in the saving of more than 1500 
lines of code.


\section{Multithreading}\label{mthread}
%Since a responsive interface is critical, even while CPU intensive processing tasks are running,
Molview, the precursor of BALLView was designed as a single-threaded 
application. As a result, the graphical user interface would freeze, while a 
calculation like a molecular dynamics simulation was running. Therefore users 
could no longer interfere with the application. This was especially tiresome 
since the calculations could not be aborted, except by shutting down the 
entire program. To circumvent these limitations, we had to redesign the VIEW 
library to use mulithreading techniques. Now all long running calculations 
like MD simulations and energy minimizations are started in their own thread.
This has several advantages:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The user interface stays responsive at any time and may thus \eg print
        estimated run times.
  \item Multithreaded calculations can be stopped with the ease of one mouse
        click.
  \item The 3D graphics widget can be used to show intermediate results \eg 
        while a minimization is running.
  \item Users can reposition the viewpoint \eg to focus on one functional group
        while a MD simulation is running.
  \item Multiple threads can make efficient use of multi-processor or multi-core
        computers.
\end{itemize}

Since multithreading has so many advantages, we also used it for further 
purposes: The (re)calculation of models and colorings are now also started in 
separate threads. A further functionality were the multithreading technique
became very handy is the dialog for downloading structures from the protein 
database. Here it allows to monitor the progress of the download and to abort 
it at any time.

\paragraph{Locking data structures and synchronization of threads}
\hspace*{\fill}\\
Unfortunately multithreading is one of the most complex fields in programing 
since the different threads have to be synchronized. The early multithreaded 
versions of our software had serious stability issues: It could \eg happen
that users modified or deleted molecular structures, which were used in 
multithreaded calculations like an MD simulation. This then resulted in 
immediate crashes. Other frequent problems were deadlocks, when two threads 
competed for access on the same data and race conditions, when two threads 
depended on each other.

To solve these and other problems, we redesigned the VIEW library such that 
it now uses strict \Index{mutex locking}: Only one modular widget can get 
exclusive access to the molecular structures or representations. To do so, it 
has to lock the molecular entities (\ie \class{Composite} objects) by calling 
the following function:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
  bool ModularWidget::lockComposites()
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
If this call is successful, the modular widget can safely access and modify 
the \class{Composite} objects or start a thread for doing so. While the 
molecular entities are locked, further calls of \class{lock\-Composites} will
fail and thus prevent any harmful changes. When the locking widget no longer 
needs access to the \class{Composite} objects, it must give up the lock with 
the following method:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
  bool ModularWidget::unlockComposites()
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
While the molecular entities are locked, the application has to notify the 
user that any changes to the structures are now forbidden: Beside showing a 
''busy'' mouse cursor, all corresponding menu entries and widgets get 
disabled. This also provides direct feedback on which actions can still be 
performed. The disabling of potentially harmful GUI elements and keyboard 
shortcuts also acts as an additional protective barrier that prevents any 
adverse effects in the program's flow.

With this two interlocking mechanism for the prevention of any harmful 
changes, the multithreading approach runs stable and it became one of the 
central features in the VIEW library.

\paragraph{Information flow between threads}
\hspace*{\fill}\\
Unfortunately we had to consider several constraints in the design of the Qt 
library: For example only the main thread is qualified to modify GUI elements. 
Therefore we had to find a proper mean to transition data between any 
additional threads and the main thread, which is a prerequisite for many 
basic tasks like showing status messages. To this end, we decided to use the 
\class{QEvent} messaging system. It allows one thread to send an event that 
will then be received in the main thread. Since the adequate class for passing 
user defined data is \class{QCustom\-Event}, we derived the class 
\class{Message\-Event} from it, which can contain any arbitrary VIEW message.
As an example the thread that (re)calculates the model and coloring of a 
\class{Representation} notifies the main thread that it has finished with the 
following code:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
  sendMessage_(new RepresentationMessage(*rep,
                         RepresentationMessage::FINISHED_UPDATE));
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
sendMessage\_ looks like the following:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
void BALLThread::sendMessage_(Message* msg)
{
  if (main_control_ == 0) return;
  // Qt will delete the MessageEvent when done
  qApp->postEvent(main_control_, new MessageEvent(msg));
}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
In the main thread, the \class{Main\-Control} then receives this event and acts
accordingly:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
bool MainControl::event(QEvent* e)
{
  if (e->type() == (QEvent::Type) MESSAGE_EVENT)
  {
    Message* msg = dynamic_cast<MessageEvent*>(e)->getMessage();
    sendMessage(*msg);
    return true;
  }

  return QMainWindow::event(e);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
As a result, all modular widgets will receive the VIEW message from the other
thread.


\section{How to Create a Geometric Primitive}
\label{section:view_create_a_geometric_primitive}

In VIEW there are a number of predefined geometric primitives already 
available, \eg {\em Sphere}, {\em Tube} etc. But sometimes a needed primitive 
may not be available and therefore must be programmed anew. 
In this section we want to create a new geometric primitive called 'Cross'.
We define a cross to be a shape that consists of three lines that merge in one
point. Additionally we require all lines to be axis aligned and meet each
other in the middle.

To accomplish this we need three properties for the geometric object: the
float member radius that describes the half length of each line, the class 
\class{Vertex} for the middle point of the geometric primitive and the class 
\class{Color\-Extension} which contains methods for changing the color of the
cross. In addition to these classes we need the main base class for
creating a geometric primitive: The \class{Geometric\-Object} 
implements the interface each geometric shape must have.

The definition of \class{Cross} looks as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
class Cross: 
  public Vertex,
  public GeometricObject
{
  public:

    Cross();

    virtual ~Cross();
		
    float getRadius() const;

    void setRadius(float new_radius);

  protected:
					
    float radius_;
};
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
As this object is derived from all the base classes, we only need to implement
a standard constructor, the destructor and the get- and set- methods for 
the radius.\footnote{The copy constructor and the copy assignment methods
have been omitted because they are not crucial to the implementation of a
primitive.} All additional functionality is provided by inheritance.

We will now have a closer look at the implementation of the drawing method. 
To be able to draw the new geometric object class, we have to add the new
method \method{render\-Cross\_} to the classes \class{Renderer} and 
\class{GL\-Renderer}.

The method \method{Renderer::\-render\_} defines which drawing methods are 
called for which geometric objects. We add the four new lines at the bottom, 
so it recognizes the new class \class{Cross}.

\begin{lstlisting}{}
void Renderer::render_(const GeometricObject* object)
{
  if      (RTTI::isKindOf<Sphere>(*object))         
  { renderSphere_(*(const Sphere*) object);
  }
  else if (RTTI::isKindOf<TwoColoredLine>(*object)) 
  { renderTwoColoredLine_(*(const TwoColoredLine*) object);
  }
  else if (RTTI::isKindOf<Cross>(*object))          
  { renderCross_(*(const Cross*) object);
  }
  ...
\end{lstlisting}

The method \method{Renderer::\-render\-Cross\_(const Cross\& cross)} will be 
overloaded by derived \class{Renderer} classes, so it only contains a 
warning, which will appear if we forget to implement it in a derived Renderer:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
virtual void renderCross_(const Cross& /* cross */)
{
  Log.error() << "renderCross_ not implemented in derived "
              << "Renderer class" << std::endl;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The method \method{GLRenderer::\-render\-Cross\_(const Cross\& cross)}
does the actual rendering, so we use OpenGL code here:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
void GLRenderer::renderCross_(const Cross& cross)
{
  glPushMatrix();
	
  // if cross is selected, use the selection color,
  // otherwise use its own color. (method from GLRenderer)
  setColor4ub_(cross);  
	
  // move to the position of the cross (method from GLRenderer)
  translateVector3_(sphere.getVertex());
	
  // OpenGL code for rendering the cross.
  glBegin(GL_LINES);
  glVertex3f((GLfloat)(getVertex().x - cross.getRadius()),
             (GLfloat)(getVertex().y),
             (GLfloat)(getVertex().z));
  glVertex3f((GLfloat)(getVertex().x + cross.getRadius()),
             (GLfloat)(getVertex().y),
             (GLfloat)(getVertex().z));

  glVertex3f((GLfloat)(getVertex().x),
             (GLfloat)(getVertex().y - cross.getRadius()),
             (GLfloat)(getVertex().z));
  glVertex3f((GLfloat)(getVertex().x),
             (GLfloat)(getVertex().y + cross.getRadius()),
             (GLfloat)(getVertex().z));

  glVertex3f((GLfloat)(getVertex().x),
             (GLfloat)(getVertex().y),
             (GLfloat)(getVertex().z - cross.getRadius()));
  glVertex3f((GLfloat)(getVertex().x),
             (GLfloat)(getVertex().y),
             (GLfloat)(getVertex().z + cross.getRadius()));
  glEnd();

  glPopMatrix();
}
\end{lstlisting}
