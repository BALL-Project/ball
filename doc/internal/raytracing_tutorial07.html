<h3>Creating High Quality Images</h3>

Unfortunately, Reflectiveness and Transparency dramatically increase the computational
demands of RTFact. <br>
To be able to interact with BALLView and to further improve your picture, however, you can 
<ul>
<li> decrease the size of BALLView's scene, and/or
<li> use the downsampling option in BALLView.
</ul>
The Downsampling factor can be set in the Preferences dialog. Click the menu entry
<br>
<b>"Edit->Preferences"</b>.
<br>
Highlight  <b>Display->Main</b> in the <b>Entries</b> list on the left side. 
<br>
Move the slider in the <b>Downsampling factor</b> box and set the downsampling factor to <b>2</b>. 
Then, activate your choice by clicking the <b>Apply</b> button.
<br>
Now the resolution is decreased, and thus allows faster interaction.
<br>
Next, change the camera position to find a nice viewpoint for your scene.
<br>

For the final picture we need to increase the resolution again.<br>
Set the <b>Downsampling factor</b> back to <b>1</b>.
<br>

<h4>Antialiasing</h4>
Have a closer look at the boundaries of the SES surface. The artefacts at the
edges can be removed using Antialiasing.<br>
Start the Antialiasing by pressing the <b>space key</b> and watch the scene closely for the next 15 seconds.<br>
The renderer will now render continously and the scene will converge to a much nicer image. This is particularly important when using reflections!
<br>
To stop the Antialiasing press again the space key.
<br>

<h4>Exporting Pictures</h4>
After our efforts to create a nice scene, let's export the scene into a picture.<br>
The current content of BALLView's scene can be exported into a PNG file by clicking 
the menu entry
<br>
<b>"File->Export Image->PNG..."</b>.
<br>
<br>
Specify the file's name and location in the upcoming dialog and <b>Save</b>.
<br>

<h4>Offscreen Rendering</h4>
For publications or even posters one might need higher resolution than the one provided by the computer screen. For those cases, BALLView offers <b>Offscreen rendering</b>.
The offscreen resolution factor can be increased in the Preferences dialog. Click the menu entry
<br>
<b>"Edit->Preferences"</b>.
<br>
Highlight  <b>Display->Main</b> in the <b>Entries</b> list on the left hand. 
Activate the <b>Use offscreen rendering for PNG's</b> box and increase the <b>resolution factor</b>to <b>4</b>.
Confirm your choice by pressing the <b>OK</b> button.<br> 
Now, export the scene again as a PNG-file (as shown above) and compare both images.
<br>

<h4>Projects</h4>
After our efforts to create a nice scene, one might want to store the molecule(s) <b>and</b> the renderer's settings together.
For this purpose, BALLView offers storing <b>Projects</b>. <br>
Projects can be stored by clicking the menu entry
<br>
<b>"File->Save Project"</b>.
<br>
