	<h3>Electrostatic visualization</h3>

Another way to visualize the electrostatics grid are <it>isocontour surfaces</it>.
These surface connect all points in a grid which have an
given value.<br> 
They are very usefull to get an understanding how far a molecule's potential reaches
into 3D space.<br>
As an example we will create two surfaces, one in red for -0.01 and one
in blue for 0.01.
