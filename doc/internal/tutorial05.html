<h3> Visualisation of trajectories </h3>

<blockquote>
To visualise the resulting trajectory, we will have a look at the 
DatasetControl. It is one of the listviews in the main window and
has the caption "Datasets". 
(Maybe it is hidden, if you don't find it, have a look at the menu
 entry <b>"Windows->Datasets"</b>.)<br><br>
The DatasetControl should have an entry for the trajectory.
To visualize it, click on the entry and open the context menu with
the right mouse button. First choose "<b>Load into RAM</b>" and then 
"<b>Visualise/Export</b>". In the Snapshot Visualization dialog press "<b>Animate</b>".
Feely free to watch the visualization for as long as you want, you can stop it, by pressing
the "Cancel" button. Then close the visualization dialog by pressing the "Close" button.
