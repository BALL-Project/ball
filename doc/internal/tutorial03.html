<h3>Hierarchy of molecules</h3>

Now lets have a look at the peptides
hierarchy. The <b>Structures</b> widget contains a hierarchical list of all loaded
molecules. Click the cross to the left of the name of your
newly created protein to open the hierarchy tree. Repeat this
to see, that the peptide clearly consists of four amino acids
(if you entered the sequence correctly).
The checkboxes at the right side of the entries can be used to mark entries, e.g.,
for identifing them in the 3D view. 
<br>
Try to check one some box and then uncheck it again.
<br><br>
When you are finished playing around with the hierarchy,
highlight the System by clicking on its name ("ARND").
This will take you to the next step of the demo.
