	  <tr><td>

<h2 align=center>Changes Since Version 1.2 (05.08.09):</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Improved stereo capabilities 3D StereoSettings:
		<ul>	
    	<li>New stereo mode: "Side-by-side on different displays" (allows the use of an additional operator window for live presentations)
      <li>Introduced a dialog for fine tuning/computing the stereo settings (adapt screen sizes, user distance, etc.) 
		</ul>
	<li>Separation of renderers from scene data:
   	<ul>
			<li>Multiple render windows are possible
   		<li>Other renderers than OpenGL are possible
		</ul>
	<li>Input Devices (experimental):
		<ul>
   		<li>Spacenavigator plugin 
		</ul>
	<li>Optionally write binary Project files
	<li>Introduced thread locking into the gui to prevent race situations
	<li>Customizable shortcuts
	<li>Add an option to load all models from a PDB file (e.g. PDB files generated from NMR data can be coped with)
	<li>Add VRML export for further editing or 3D printing
	<li>Improved handling of lightsources
	<li>Editable materials for the 3D structures
	<li>Start to work on more consistency in the gui
	<li>Accelerate working with representations
	<li>Line smoothing can now be disabled. This makes the line representation look less cluttered.
	<li>Added a switch for changing between perspective and orthographic projection 
	<li>Fixes to the OpenGL visualization in BALLView
	<li>Fixed the POVRay Exporter
	<li>Changing the PDB download URL works again
	<li>Made offscreen rendering work better than ever
	<li>Reworked some icons to play better with dark colorthemes
	<li>Improved the SpaceNavigatorPlugin (MacOS support)
	<li>Fixes to the Stereo mode
	<li>Added a nice splash screen :-)
	<li>Splitted the 3D toolbar
</ul>
<h2 align=center>Changes Since Version 1.1.1 (14.11.07):</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Integrated molecule editor
  <li>Volume rendering for electrostaticsm, projection onto planes, field lines
  <li>Improved cartoon and ribbon models, non-photorealistic shading (toon shader)
  <li>Off-screen rendering
  <li>Toolbars for quick access to important functionality
  <li>Numerous improvements to the interface
  <li>Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF 94)
	<li>Automated download of structures from PDB and PubChem
</ul>

<h2 align=center>Changes Since Version 1.1 (21.06.05):</h2>

The version 1.1.1 finally brings full Python, DLL and Makefile support under Windows.
Furthermore there is a large number of prominent fixes (especially for g++ 4.x) 
and some new functionality for BALLView.<br>
<br>

Added:
<ul>
 <li>Support for Python under Windows
 <li>Python support for further classes 
 <li>Support for creating animations and movies per Python script
 <li>Further Python example scripts
 <li>Support for SD files in BALLView
 <li>Some sensible Hotkeys for Python Scripts in BALLView
 <li>Context sensitive HTML documentation in BALLView
 <li>BALLView again has a fourth drawing precision "ultra" for real 
   fast graphics accelerator cards
 <li>Amber charges and radii values for nucleotides
 <li>Picking support for bonds
 <li>Coloring by molecule
</ul>

Changed:
<ul>
 <li>BALL and BALLView libraries are now built as DLLs under Windows
 <li>Both libraries are now compiled with optimization under Windows
 <li>Visual improvements of the DNA cartoon model
 <li>Renamed Mesh::colorList to Mesh::colors
 <li>Exception::InvalidRange now has a float value
 <li>Bond::TooManyBonds moved to Exception namespace
 <li>A standard BALLView Python startup script will be executed in any case.
 	 It can be found in BALL/data/startup.py.
   Users can choose an additional startup script, that will run afterwards.
 <li>PyInterpreter and PyWidget report the reason if the Python module can not be loaded
 <li>Removed Notification and changed the way to register for Log access 
 <li>Removed GLQuadricObject. This functionality is available through GLRenderer
 <li>Improved PreferenceEntry class and reading/storing code for preferences
 <li>Coloring of surfaces by grid: the way autoscale works and the default colors
 <li>Renamed ColorTable to ColorMap
 <li>Cleanup of the Scene code for move, rotate, zoom: Now cleaner, smaller and faster code.
 <li>Adapted DownloadPDBDialog to new rcsb.org website
</ul>

Fixed:
<ul>
 <li>Problems with POSIX compliance of socket classes
 <li>Crash while reading PDB files with too many bonds
 <li>Crash while wrongly using malformed boolean expression "residueID(...)"
 <li>Crash in CalculateSecondaryStructureProcessor, when one SS is part of another
 <li>Crash while running an MDS with trajectory if the DCD file could not be written
 <li>Crash with representations for two different systems
 <li>Crash with mouse movements while animation is running
 <li>NMRViewer and underlying widgets did not compile
 <li>Problems in persistence with g++ 4.x series
 <li>Hangup in socket interface with g++ 4.x series
 <li>Mouse sensitivity changed in Rotate mode when focusing on small structures
 <li>Memory issues with Python objects (e.g. inserting GeometricObjects into Representations)
 <li>Lighting, especially for directional lights
 <li>Saving and loading of BALLView project files
 <li>Accelerators for menu entries didn't always work
 <li>Splitting of surfaces for given distance: computed incorrect surfaces
 <li>POVRay export: degenerated objects (with a length of 0) and meshes with only one color
 <li>Missing assignment operator in RotamerLibrary
 <li>Browse button didn't work in Molecular Dynamics Simulation dialog
 <li>Incorrect bond orders and GLN amide group planarity in fragment database
 <li>PeptideBuilder: Naming of peptides; enabled support for paste in Dialog
 <li>Opening of files in current directory per command line with BALLView
 <li>Rendering of Fog
 <li>Update of Representations after changing Selection color
 <li>Problems with rendering Labels on Windows and MacOS
 <li>Problems with Directory and Sysinfo on Windows
 <li>Problems with ATI graphics cards: Line Models and Polygon Smoothing
 <li>Minor problems with the clipping planes
 <li>Minor problems with dashed bonds in the Ball-and-Stick model
</ul>
