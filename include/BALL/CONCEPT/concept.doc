 /**	\defgroup Persistence Object Persistence.
	 		\ingroup Concepts
			Ball provides support for the serialization and deserialization of
			objects and their platform-independent storage.
			<br>	
			All persistent objects have to be derived from PersistentObject.  The
			management, serialization, and deserialization is performed by the
			PersistenceManager class. A persistence manager possess an input
			stream and an output stream (<em> persistent streams </em>).  It can write
			objects to the output stream, thereby converting them to a portable
			format and serializing all dependend objects, too. It can also read
			objects from the input stream, create the corresponding objects
			dynamically and demangle pointers and references.
			<br>
			There are two main problems related with this trivial persistence
			concept:
				- multiple inheritence from a single base class
				- static members variables
			These problems are inherent problems of C++ and cannot be solved.
			However, they can be avoided in most cases. To circumvent problems
			related to multiple instances of a common base class (which would
			normally require virtual inheritence - but this does not solve the
			problem), we introduced the model <b> storable </b>. Storable objects
			are not derived from PersistentObject, but they provide two functions
			(read/write) to write themselves to a persistent stream and to
			retrieve their contents again.
			<br>	
			Static member variables should usually be ignored when
			reading/writing persistent objects.  However, this has to be decided
			on a case-by-case basis.

	/**	\defgroup ClassTest Class Black Box Testing
		To provide a maximum reliability for all BALL classes, each class
		provides its own test program to ensure that each class compiles
		and behaves (at least basically) as intended.

		The testprograms reside in the directory source/TEST, they may 
		be built and executed by calling <b>make test</b>.

		Each test program prints after execution either "PASSED" or "FAILED".
		If any of the subtest contained in the test program fails, the whole 
		test failed. The result of the test program can also be checked via its
		exit code. An exit code of zero means "PASSED", non-zero exit code means 
		"FAILED".

		There are several macros defined to simplify the creation of a test program
		and to provide a common interface.
		Each test program consists of several subtests which usually test one
		method or property of the class. Each of this subtests uses a series
		of elementary tests to check the functionality of the method.

		A number of elementary tests has been implemented that is sufficient
		for most cases:
			- \link #TEST_EQUAL TEST_EQUAL \endlink 
			- \link #TEST_NOT_EQUAL TEST_NOT_EQUAL \endlink 
			- \link #TEST_REAL_EQUAL TEST_REAL_EQUAL \endlink 
		A subtest is defined by calling the  \link #CHECK CHECK \endlink  macro with the subtest name
		as an argument. Then a series of calls to <b>TEST</b> macros follows,
		mixed with standard BALL code (remember to include all neccessary header files).
		The subtest is terminated by calling  \link #RESULT RESULT \endlink .
		Use the two macros  \link #START_TEST START_TEST \endlink  and  \link #END_TEST END_TEST \endlink  to generate a complete
		test program.

		To create a new test program, use the file
