        /**     @name Different color classes.
	                    That are the two different color classes in VIEW.
                      The class ColorRGBA uses the RGBA parameter to define a
                      color. Because of the conversion class ColorUnit different
                      types of input parameter are possible.
                      The class ColorHSV uses the HSV parameter to define a
                      color. It uses the class ColorUnit for the {\em S} and {\em V} component.
                      These two components as all RGBA components are of range {\em 0 - 255}.
                      The {\em H} component however is of range {\em 0 - 360}. Therefore
                      the class ColorUnitHue is used for different types of input
                      parameter.
